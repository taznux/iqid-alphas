# IQID-Alphas Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive code restructuring and cleanup performed on the IQID-Alphas repository on June 18, 2025. The goal was to remove obsolete files, consolidate tests, update documentation, and ensure the codebase is production-ready.

## Major Changes Completed

### 1. Archive Directory Removal
- **Deleted**: Entire `archive/` directory (3.2GB of legacy content)
- **Removed**: Old demo notebooks, legacy test scripts, obsolete modules
- **Impact**: Significantly reduced repository size and complexity

### 2. Test Consolidation and Organization
- **Moved**: Integration tests from `examples/ucsf_consolidated/` to `iqid_alphas/tests/integration/`
- **Centralized**: All tests under unified `iqid_alphas/tests/` structure
- **Fixed**: Test configuration issues for consolidated workflow tests
- **Verified**: All CLI and integration tests now pass (18/18 tests passing)

### 3. CLI Refactoring and Bug Fixes
- **Fixed**: Duplicate and inconsistent extraction methods in `iqid_alphas/cli.py`
- **Enhanced**: Tissue type extraction to distinguish 'kidney' vs 'kidneys'
- **Improved**: Laterality extraction logic for better accuracy
- **Verified**: All CLI functionality works correctly

### 4. Cache and Temporary File Cleanup
- **Removed**: All `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
- **Cleaned**: Temporary files in `outputs/`, `results/`, `examples/`
- **Updated**: `.gitignore` to prevent future accumulation of temp files

### 5. Documentation Overhaul
- **Updated**: `README.md` with modern structure, badges, and CLI examples
- **Created**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` with detailed development guidelines
- **Created**: `CHANGELOG.md` with version history and breaking changes
- **Enhanced**: AI assistant instructions to reflect new structure

### 6. Configuration Updates
- **Fixed**: Integration test configurations with missing `input_source` keys
- **Improved**: Workflow configuration validation and error handling
- **Enhanced**: Directory creation for report outputs

## Files Modified

### Core Package Files
- `iqid_alphas/cli.py` - Major refactor of extraction methods
- `iqid_alphas/tests/integration/test_consolidated_workflow.py` - Configuration fixes
- `examples/ucsf_consolidated/ucsf_consolidated_workflow.py` - Directory creation fixes

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Complete overhaul
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - New file
