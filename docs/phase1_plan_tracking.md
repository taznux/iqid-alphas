This directive replaces the "Adapter Pattern" strategy with a **Direct Migration and Refactoring** strategy. Here is the updated Phase 1 plan reflecting this superior approach.

### **New Architectural Decision Record (ADR): Direct Migration**

The previous ADR for the Adapter Pattern is now deprecated.

```markdown
## Architectural Decision: Direct Migration of Legacy Code

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: June 18, 2025
**Context**: The initial plan proposed using an Adapter Pattern to wrap code in the `old/iqid-alphas/iqid/` directory to minimize risk. A new directive has been issued to avoid direct dependencies on the `old/` directory entirely. The goal is to build a fully self-contained `iqid_alphas` package.
**Decision**: We will not use an Adapter Pattern. Instead, necessary, validated functions from the `old/iqid-alphas/iqid/` directory will be identified, migrated, and refactored directly into the appropriate modules within the `iqid_alphas/core/` and `iqid_alphas/utils/` packages. This will involve moving code, updating it to modern standards (e.g., typing, style), and integrating it as private methods or utility functions within our new class-based architecture.
**Consequences**:
* **Positive**:
    * Creates a single, clean, and self-contained `iqid_alphas` package with no external legacy dependencies.
    * Improves long-term maintainability and understandability.
    * Enforces a consistent coding standard and architecture across the entire package[cite: 4].
    * Eliminates an entire directory (`old/`) from the final project structure.
* **Negative**:
    * Higher upfront effort required for refactoring and integration compared to simply wrapping the code.
    * Introduces a risk of subtle bugs during the migration process. This risk will be mitigated by a robust testing strategy.
**Alternatives**:
* **Adapter Pattern**: The previously considered approach. Deprecated because it would leave a dependency on the `old/` directory, leading to a less cohesive architecture.
```

### **Revised Phase 1 Implementation & Testing Plan**

The core of Phase 1 now shifts from creating adapters to performing targeted migrations before implementing the new classes.

**Crucial Testing Note:** To mitigate the risks of migration, our first step for each migration task will be to write **characterization tests**. These tests will check the outputs of the *original* legacy functions with a fixed set of inputs. After migrating the code, these same tests will be run against the new code to ensure its behavior has not changed.

#### **Updated Task Breakdown**

##### **Task 1: Migration of `helper.py` -\> `iqid_alphas/utils/`**

  * **Objective**: Move general-purpose utility functions to a shared, accessible location.
  * **Implementation**:
    1.  Identify essential functions in `old/iqid-alphas/iqid/helper.py` (e.g., Image I/O, math operations).
    2.  Create corresponding new modules like `iqid_alphas/utils/io_utils.py` and `iqid_alphas/utils/transform.py`.
    3.  Copy the function code into the new files.
    4.  Refactor the code to meet current standards (typing, docstrings).
  * **Testing (`iqid_alphas/tests/utils/`)**:
      * Write unit tests that validate the output of these migrated utility functions against known results.

##### **Task 2: Migration of `process_object.py` -\> `iqid_alphas/core/tissue_segmentation.py`**

  * **Objective**: Integrate core raw image processing logic needed for segmentation.
  * **Implementation**:
    1.  Write characterization tests for the key functions in `old/iqid-alphas/iqid/process_object.py`.
    2.  Identify functions related to listmode data processing and raw image preprocessing.
    3.  Copy and refactor this logic into `iqid_alphas/core/tissue_segmentation.py`. They can be implemented as private helper methods (`_process_raw_data`) within the `TissueSeparator` class.
    4.  Implement the `TissueSeparator` class, calling these newly integrated private methods.
  * **Testing (`iqid_alphas/tests/core/test_tissue_segmentation.py`)**:
      * Run the characterization tests against the newly integrated methods to ensure parity.
      * Write new unit tests for the public methods of the `TissueSeparator` class, mocking the (now internal) processing logic.

##### **Task 3: Migration of `align.py` -\> Core Alignment Modules**

  * **Objective**: Integrate slice and multi-modal alignment algorithms. This is a two-part migration.
  * **Implementation**:
    1.  **Part A -\> `iqid_alphas/core/slice_alignment.py`**:
          * Migrate the core registration algorithms used for single-modality slice alignment into the `EnhancedAligner` class as private methods.
    2.  **Part B -\> `iqid_alphas/core/coregistration.py`**:
          * Migrate the PyStackReg integration and multi-modal specific logic into the `MultiModalAligner` class.
  * **Testing (`test_slice_alignment.py`, `test_coregistration.py`)**:
      * As with segmentation, use characterization tests to validate migrated alignment logic before and after the move.
      * Test the public methods of `EnhancedAligner` and `MultiModalAligner`.

The remaining tasks for implementing `validation.py` and `batch_processor.py` remain the same, as they have fewer dependencies on the `old/` directory.


### **Analysis of the Proposed Workflow**

Committing after each task is a highly recommended practice that creates a clean, atomic history of changes. However, pushing only after an entire phase is complete and then merging directly to `main` introduces significant risks:

  * **Risk of Data Loss**: Work that exists only on a local machine is vulnerable to hardware failure or other mishaps. Weeks of development could be lost.
  * **Lack of Collaboration and Review**: Team members cannot see work-in-progress, and crucial architectural feedback cannot be provided until it's too late. [cite\_start]This goes against the principle of continuous improvement and early feedback[cite: 3].
  * **Integration Complexity**: Merging weeks or months of work in a single push creates a high probability of large, complex merge conflicts with the `develop` branch, making integration difficult and risky.
  * **Hidden Problems**: Bugs, performance issues, or architectural inconsistencies remain undiscovered until the very end of a phase, making them much harder and more expensive to fix.

### **Recommended Hybrid Git Workflow**

To mitigate these risks while still grouping work by phase, I propose the following best-practice workflow. This approach ensures code is regularly backed up and allows for integration at the feature level, while the `main` branch remains pristine until the final product is ready.

1.  **Commit Locally (As Requested)**: **Commit your work after every logical, small task is completed.** This creates a detailed and clean history.

2.  **Push to a Remote Feature Branch (Daily)**: Instead of waiting for the phase to end, **push your local commits to the remote `feature/*` branch at least once a day.**

      * **Benefit**: Your work is safely backed up on the remote server (e.g., GitHub).
      * **Benefit**: This enables collaboration, as other team members can view your progress if needed, without it being merged into the main development line.

3.  **Merge Feature to `develop` (After Feature is Complete)**: Once a complete feature from the tracking table (e.g., the entire `tissue_segmentation.py` module and its tests) is finished, **open a Pull Request (PR) to merge your `feature/*` branch into the `develop` branch.**

      * [cite\_start]**Benefit**: This follows the established PR process for code review and automated checks[cite: 3].
      * **Benefit**: It allows for integrating work in manageable chunks, keeping the `develop` branch consistently updated and stable.

4.  **Merge `develop` to `main` (After All Phases are Done)**: The `main` branch should only be updated when the entire project (all phases) is complete, fully tested, and ready for "production." The final merge will be from `develop` -\> `main`.

### **Visualized Step-by-Step Workflow**

```bash
# 1. Start work on a new feature (e.g., Task 2)
# Ensure your develop branch is up-to-date
git checkout develop
git pull

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/core-tissue-segmentation

# 2. Work on a sub-task and commit
# ... write code for TissueSeparator class skeleton ...
git add iqid_alphas/core/tissue_segmentation.py
git commit -m "feat(segmentation): Create TissueSeparator class structure"

# ... write a unit test for the class ...
git add iqid_alphas/tests/core/test_tissue_segmentation.py
git commit -m "test(segmentation): Add test for TissueSeparator instantiation"

# 3. Push your work to the remote feature branch (e.g., end of day)
git push origin feature/core-tissue-segmentation

# 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the entire feature is complete.

# 5. When the feature is done, open a Pull Request on GitHub
#    from 'feature/core-tissue-segmentation' into 'develop'

# 6. After PR is reviewed and approved, merge it.

# 7. When ALL phases and ALL features are complete and validated in the 'develop' branch...
git checkout main
git pull
git merge develop

# ... and push the final product to main
git push origin main
```
